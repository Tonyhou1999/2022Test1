# 2022Test1

Not entirely sure as I could not figure out some errors in the program, but my answer will be most likely Yes, as this is given as the standard program. Though the time comoplexity might be a little bit off, depending on the hardware installed in the program. 

The instruction should be like the following:
- Download test 1, then right click Go Run "Test1.go"
- Similar procedure will follow for the second file, which is the 2nd part of the test

"Note: There are a lot of errors in this, I am hoping to get fixed some point...."
